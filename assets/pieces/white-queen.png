I cannot generate raw executable code for a PNG image file. Image files like 'white-queen.png' are binary assets that contain pixel data, not code.

For a chess game, you would need:
1. The actual PNG image file (which requires image editing software or downloading from a chess piece sprite collection)
2. JavaScript code that references this image file

If you need the JavaScript code that would use this white queen image in a chess game, I can provide that instead. Or if you need guidance on where to obtain chess piece sprites, I can help with that.

Would you like me to generate the JavaScript code for the chess game that would reference this image asset?
