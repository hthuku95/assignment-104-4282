I cannot generate executable code for a PNG image file. Image files contain binary data that represents visual content, not executable code.

For a black rook chess piece sprite, you would need:

1. An actual PNG image file created with image editing software
2. Or an SVG version that could be represented as code

If you need an SVG version of a black rook chess piece that could be saved as code, I could provide that instead. Or if you need JavaScript code to handle loading and displaying the black rook image in your chess game, I could provide that functionality.

Would you like me to generate:
- SVG code for a black rook chess piece?
- JavaScript code to handle the black rook piece in your chess game?
- CSS code for styling the black rook piece?
