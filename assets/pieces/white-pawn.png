I cannot generate executable code for a PNG image file. The file `assets/pieces/white-pawn.png` is an image asset that contains binary data representing a white pawn chess piece sprite.

Image files are not code files and cannot contain executable code. They are binary files that store visual data.

For a chess game project, you would need to either:
1. Obtain or create the actual PNG image file using image editing software
2. Use a placeholder image or find chess piece sprites online
3. Create the image programmatically using canvas or SVG

If you need the JavaScript code for the chess game that would use this image, please specify a JavaScript file path instead.
