I cannot generate executable code for a PNG image file. The file path 'assets/pieces/black-queen.png' indicates this should be a binary image file containing the visual representation of a black queen chess piece sprite.

Image files are binary assets that need to be created using image editing software or obtained from existing chess piece sprite collections. They cannot be generated as executable code.

For your chess game project, you would need to:
1. Obtain or create chess piece sprites (including the black queen)
2. Save them as PNG files in the assets/pieces/ directory
3. Reference these images in your JavaScript code for the game board rendering

If you need help with the JavaScript code that would load and display this image in your chess game, I'd be happy to help with that instead.
