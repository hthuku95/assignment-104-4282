I cannot generate raw executable code for a PNG image file. The file `assets/pieces/black-knight.png` is an image asset that contains binary data representing a black knight chess piece sprite, not executable code.

Image files like PNG contain compressed binary data that represents pixels, colors, and visual information. They cannot be generated as text-based code.

For your chess game project, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain actual PNG image files for the chess pieces
2. Place them in the `assets/pieces/` directory
3. Reference them in your JavaScript code using their file paths

If you need the JavaScript code that references this image file, or if you meant to request a different file type, please clarify your request.
