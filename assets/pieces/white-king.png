I cannot generate raw executable code for a PNG image file. The file `assets/pieces/white-king.png` is an image asset that contains binary data representing a white king chess piece sprite, not executable code.

Image files are binary assets that need to be created using image editing software or obtained from existing chess piece icon sets. They cannot be generated as text-based code.

For your chess game project, you would need to either:
1. Create the chess piece images using graphic design software
2. Download chess piece sprites from free icon libraries
3. Use Unicode chess symbols as an alternative
4. Generate SVG-based chess pieces programmatically

If you need help with the JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files for your chess game, I'd be happy to generate those code files instead.
