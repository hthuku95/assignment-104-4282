I cannot generate executable code for a PNG image file. Image files like 'black-king.png' are binary assets that contain pixel data for the black king chess piece sprite, not executable code.

To obtain this image file, you would need to:

1. Create or download a black king chess piece sprite image
2. Save it as a PNG file in the assets/pieces/ directory
3. Ensure it matches the visual style of your other chess pieces

The image would typically be a square PNG (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128 pixels) with a transparent background, showing a black king chess piece that will be displayed on your chess board.
