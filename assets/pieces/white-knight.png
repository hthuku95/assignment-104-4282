I cannot generate executable code for a PNG image file. Image files like 'white-knight.png' are binary assets that contain pixel data, not code.

For a chess game project, you would need to either:

1. Use an existing white knight chess piece image from a chess set
2. Create the image using graphic design software
3. Use a chess piece font or icon library
4. Generate it programmatically using canvas/SVG

If you need the actual chess game JavaScript code or other code files for your chess project, please specify those file types instead.
