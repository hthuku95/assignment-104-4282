This is an image file, not a code file. Image files contain binary data that cannot be represented as raw executable code text. 

For a chess game, you would need an actual PNG image file of a black pawn chess piece sprite. This would typically be:

1. A small PNG image (e.g., 64x64 or 80x80 pixels)
2. A black-colored pawn chess piece
3. Transparent background for proper rendering on the chessboard
4. Clean, recognizable chess piece design

You'll need to obtain or create this image file using image editing software or download it from a chess piece sprite collection. The file should be placed in the `assets/pieces/` directory as `black-pawn.png`.
