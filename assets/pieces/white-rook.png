I cannot generate raw executable code for a PNG image file. Image files like 'white-rook.png' are binary assets that contain pixel data, not code.

For a chess game, you would need to either:

1. Use an existing white rook chess piece image from a chess sprite set
2. Create the image using graphic design software
3. Use a chess font or Unicode chess symbols
4. Generate SVG code for a white rook piece

If you need an SVG representation of a white rook that could be saved as code, I could provide that instead. Or if you need the JavaScript code for the chess game that would reference this image file, I can generate that.

Would you like me to generate SVG code for a white rook chess piece, or would you prefer the JavaScript chess game code that would use this image asset?
