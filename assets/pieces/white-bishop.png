Since this is an image file (white-bishop.png), I cannot generate the actual binary image data as raw executable code. Image files contain binary data that represents pixel information and cannot be created as text-based code.

For a chess game project, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain actual PNG image files for chess pieces
2. Use image editing software or download chess piece sprites
3. Save them as PNG files in the assets/pieces/ directory

The white bishop image would typically be a 64x64 or 128x128 pixel PNG file showing a white chess bishop piece with a transparent background.

If you need the JavaScript code to handle loading and displaying this image in your chess game, I can provide that instead. Would you like me to generate the JavaScript code that references and uses this image file?
